#Testing
Automated testing should be performed as everytime as possible. Its the only way that ensure quality software and a good design.  


##Unity Testing
Unit testing is a particular kind of testing which is responsible for testing a very isolated feature. In other words, this kind of project aims to run testing in isolation of other components. Normally, this type of test its inside the package ```app/src/test/java```.
The most commons unit testing frameworks available are the following:

- [Truth](https://github.com/google/truth)
- [RobotEletric](http://robolectric.org/)
- [JUnit](http://junit.org/junit4/) - version 5 its coming up! :) -
- [MoreAsserts](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/test/MoreAsserts.html)
- [AssertJ Android](http://square.github.io/assertj-android/)
- [ViewAsserts](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/test/ViewAsserts.html)

##Instrumentation Testing
Instrutamentation tests do require an emulator or actual device to run. They can be described as tests that are performed when its needed to control the Android's components lifecycle (e.g. drive the activities instead of having these driven by the system). tipically they are place inside ```app/src/androidTest/java``` package.

- [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/espresso-testing.html)
- [UIAutomator](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/ui-testing/uiautomator-testing.html)
- [Google Android Testing](https://developer.android.com/studio/test/index.html)
- [Robotium](https://github.com/RobotiumTech/robotium)
- [Selendroid](http://selendroid.io/)


##Mocking 
Mocking objects are objects responsible for "mimic" real domain objets. 

- [Mockito](http://mockito.org/)
- [EasyMock](http://easymock.org/)
- [PowerMock](https://github.com/jayway/powermock)


#Tools
